The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset
to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, I aim to uncover
trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal
factors that contribute to terrorist activities.
